# JsonToPojo
Quick and dirty JSON to POJO converter, creates immutable Java classes with the necessary Jackson annotations

This has no dependencies (such as jQuery, etc).

Not that unnamed objects will be given default names. Also, fields/objects with illegal Java names will have to be fixed manually.
